# Social Bot Detection through Structural Holes and Centrality Measures: Analyzing the Position of Humans and Bots in Networks  

## Authors  
**Boen Liu** – Brainstorming, Writing, Coding, Social Network Analysis, Visualizations  

## Disclaimer  
This project was submitted for **STATS201: Machine Learning for Social Science**, instructed by **Prof. Luyao Zhang** at **Duke Kunshan University** in Spring 2025.  

## Acknowledgments  
Special thanks to **Prof. Luyao Zhang** for valuable suggestions and guidance throughout the project. Appreciation also goes to my **two classmates** for their insightful feedback and revisions. Additionally, this project benefited from **ChatGPT** for **language refinement and structuring GitHub content**, as well as **Python** for **coding and analysis**.  

## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth  
This project has been a valuable learning experience, teaching me how to **systematically and rigorously conduct research**—from formulating research questions to identifying appropriate datasets, generating ideas, conducting experiments, and writing up findings. The process also enhanced my skills in **social network analysis, visualization, and applying machine learning to social science problems**.
